// In the code below, morph the while loop
// into a for loop that uses the same variable names. Remember, you’ll still
// need to declare the starting number of goldfish and the number of months to
// print outside the loop. We’ve given you the starting number of goldfish
// again, as well as the amount of months you’ll need to print out for use in
// the loop parameters.

var numGoldfish = 4;
var monthsToPrint = 12;
let monthNumber = 1

// while(monthNumber <= monthsToPrint) {
//
//   numGoldfish *= 4;
//
//   console.log("There will be " + numGoldfish + " goldfish after " + monthNumber + " month(s)!");
//
//   monthNumber++;
// }


for (monthNumber; monthNumber <= monthsToPrint;) {
    numGoldfish *= 4
    if (numGoldfish === Infinity) {
        break
    }
    console.log("There will be " + numGoldfish + " goldfish after " + monthNumber + " month(s)!");

}
