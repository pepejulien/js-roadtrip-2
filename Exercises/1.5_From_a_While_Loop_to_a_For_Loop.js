// Video 1.4 accompanies this exercise

// Write a basic for loop that prints to the console all
// the numbers from 1 to 10 in descending order. This is the similar to one
// of the previous challenges, but this time weâ€™re using a for loop instead
// of a while loop.


for (var i = 0; i < 11; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
